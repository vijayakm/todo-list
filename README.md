## Improvements

While the app is functional, there are several areas where you can improve it:
While the app is functional, it's important to note that I made only a few tests due to time constraints. Testing is a crucial aspect of software development.

1. **Android Testing**: Since you only have an iPhone simulator, it's important to test the app on an Android device or emulator to ensure it works seamlessly on both platforms.

2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance the app's user interface and user experience. 

3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize your app's performance, especially if the to-do list becomes very large. Consider implementing pagination or virtualization for long lists.
